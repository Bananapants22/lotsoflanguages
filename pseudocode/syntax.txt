Here is the pseudocode syntax:

Variables (and Constants):
Assigning:
To assign a variable, use variable = value
All variables are to be in camelCase or snake_case
Constants are to be in ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE
Variables are made global with the global keyword placed in front of them.

Casting:
To make a variable a string, use variable = str(variable)
To make a variable an integer, use variable = int(variable)
To make a variable a float, use variable = float(variable)

Input and Output:
Input:
To ask for input with a message, and store the input in a variable, use variable = input(message)

Output:
To output a message, use print(message)

Iteration:
For Loops:
To do something n times, use:

for i = 0 to n
  do_something()
next i


While Loops:
To do something while a condition is not true, use:

while condition != true
  do_something()
endwhile


Do-Until
To do something until a condition is true:

do
  do_something()
until condition == true


Operators:
Mathematical:
To do addition, use +
To do subtraction, use -
To do multiplication, use *
To do division, use /
To do quotient, use DIV
To do modulus, use MOD or %
To do exponentiation, use ^

Comparisons:
To do equal to, use ==
To do not equal to, use != or <>
To do less than, use <
To do less than or equal to, use <=
To do greater than, use >
To do greater than or equal to, use >=

Logical:
To do and, use AND
To do or, use OR
To do not, use NOT

Selection:
If/Else:
To use if statements, use the following structure:

if conditionA then
  do_something()
elsif conditionB then
  do_something_else()
else
  do_something_else_else()
endif


Switch/Case:
To use switch/case statements, use the following structure: (Why would you want to though?)

switch condition:
  case conditionA:
    do_something()
  case conditionB:
    do_something_else()
  default:
    do_something_else_else()
endswitch


String Handling:
Length:
To get the length of a string, use string.length()

Substrings:
To get a substring that starts at a specific postion and that is a number of characters long, use string.substring(start,length)

Subroutines:
Functions
To define a function with arguments, start with function name (argument) and end with endfunction
To return a value from a function, use return value

Procedures
To define a procedure with arguments, start with procedure name (argument) and end with endprocedure

Calling
To call a function or procedure on some data in the main program, use name(data)

Arrays
To define an array called name of length x, use array name[x]
To define a 2D array called name of x arrays of length y, use array name[x,y]

Comments
Start all single-line comments with //
Enclose all multi-line comments with ''' at both ends

If a simple function or procedure not mentioned here is to be used, such as swap() or round(), just put a comment at the end of the line to describe what it should do, as in the example below:

a, b = swap(a, b) // Swaps the values of a and b
