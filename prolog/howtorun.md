# This is a description of how to run the code using SWI-Prolog on Raspberry Pi
First, open the file in SWI-Prolog using: 
```
swipl filename.pl
```

Alternatively, you can open SWI-Prolog with `swipl`, then open the file using:
```prolog
['filename.pl'].
```

Once the file is open, make sure it is compiled using:
```prolog
make.
```

You can edit the file using:
```prolog
edit(filename).
```
Remember to compile it using `make.` after editing!
