### This folder contains the prolog code!

It will be written and run using SWI-Prolog.

At the moment, I am not very good at it, so the syntax is unlikely to be written for a very long time!

Prolog code looks like this:
```prolog
% This is a comment
relation( thingA, thingB).

related( X, Y) :-
  relation( X, Y).
```
